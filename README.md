#  Page Replacement Simulator with ML & Classic Algorithms

This project simulates and compares various **Page Replacement Algorithms** including classic techniques like **FIFO**, **LRU**, **LFU**, and a **Hybrid approach**, alongside a **Machine Learning-based algorithm**. It provides detailed analytics such as hit rate, fault rate, efficiency, and execution time — and even visualizes results with graphs and popup tables!

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Classic Algorithms: FIFO, LRU, LFU
- ⚡ Hybrid Optimal Strategy
- 🤖 ML-Based Algorithm using Decision Trees
- 📊 Graphical Analysis of:
  - Hit Rate vs Fault Rate
  - Efficiency Comparison
  - Execution Time
- 🪟 Popup Table View for sequence and frames
- 📝 Terminal-friendly and GUI integration
- 🔍 Easily test different input sequences and frame sizes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- `matplotlib` for visualizations
- `tkinter` for GUI popups
- `sklearn` for ML-based prediction
- `tabulate` for terminal tables
- Custom modules: `fifo.py`, `lru.py`, `lfu.py`, `hybrid.py`, `ml_based.py`, `input_taker.py`, `frames.py`
